Welcome to the *Greek New Testament Collations* website (version {{< var version >}}, up to date as of {{< var listeupdated >}}).

This website contains collations of all the Greek New Testament manuscripts for which the [Institute for New Testament Textual Research](https://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/home) (*Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung*, INTF) has published transcriptions. The collations are all made against the [Byzantine majority text](https://byzantinetext.com/study/editions/robinson-pierpont/) as published by Maurice A. Robinson and William Pierpont [-@ntrp18]. This website is *not* an official resource of the INTF.

To read the collations library, go to the [*Liste*](liste.qmd) and select a manuscript. You can alternatively see the manuscript attestation of a given chapter of the New Testament by visiting the [Chapters](chapters.qmd). To learn about the Byzantine majority text, you can read Maurice A. Robinson's [essay](byzantine_priority.qmd) on the subject [@rpi5:appendix]. The essay is also available in a [Spanish translation](byzantine_priority_es.qmd) [@superspa].
